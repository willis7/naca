/**
 * Class enumerating all existing log levels.
 * Log levels are used to decide if a particular {@link LogEvent} has enough
 * importance to be accepted by {@link LogCenter}.
 * <ul>
 * 	<lh>There is basically two kinds of events:</lh>
 * 	<li>Events raised to signal errors during the application/service
 * 	activity.</li>
 * 	<li>Events raised to signal particular actions during the
 * 	normal application/service activity. Examples of normal actions are:
 * 	starting the application/service, processing one element of information,
 * 	logging in or out a user...</li> 
 * </ul>
 * Additionally to their type (see {@link LogEventType}), events can have
 * different importance level. Assigning a level to an event
 * is usually done by extending the {@link LogEvent} class. Thus, deciding
 * which level give to an event is a decision taken by the developped using the
 * <i>jlib.log</i> package. Here are some suggestions:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li><i>{@link #Critical}</i> This is the highest level of importance.
 * 	It should be used only for exceptions signaling complete catastrophes
 * 	like: out of memory, disk full, unreachable database. A critical
 * 	event should be raised if the application/service is about to stop.</li>
 * 	<li><i>{@link #Important}</i> The second highest level of importance should
 * 	be used for exceptions that don't oblige the application to stop (for example,
 * 	an application processing a hundred data elements should raise a <i>Important</i>
 *  level event if one of the elements could not be processed, but this doesn't
 *  compromise the next elements). Also, for non-exception events, the 
 *  <i>Important</i> level should be reserved for high-level informations
 *  like the number of datas processed by an application.</li>
 * 	<li><i>{@link #Normal}</i> Normal events usually signal normal application
 * 	activity, such as those described above.</li>
 * 	<li><i>{@link #Verbose}</i> This level (as <i>Debug</i> and <i>FineDebug</i>) 
 *  should be used to signal particular circumstances detected during a 
 *  process. If those circumstances are normal, they can be starting or
 *  finishing a phase in the information processing. If those circumstances
 *  are suspicious, they may not have immediat impact on the result, but often
 *  a higher level event will shortly be raised.</li>
 * 	<li><i>{@link #Debug}</i>This level (as <i>Verbose</i> and <i>FineDebug</i>) 
 *  should be used to signal particular circumstances detected during a 
 *  process. If those circumstances are normal, they can be calling a
 *  delicate method, or switching between two main decisions during the information 
 *  processing. If those circumstances are suspicious, they may not have impact on the 
 *  result, but can explain a higher level event being raised shortly after.</li>
 * 	<li><i>{@link #FineDebug}</i>This level (as <i>Verbose</i> and <i>Debug</i>) 
 *  should be used to signal any debug circumtance happening during normal
 *  application/activity (as entering a method, number of data retrieved from
 *  a sql request...)</li>
 * </ul>
