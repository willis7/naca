/**
 * Abstract class declaring the basic interface for a <i>flow</i>.
 * The events (see {@link LogEvent}) raised by applications (by calling
 * the {@link Log#log} method) are classified under two different criteria:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Their level ({@link LogLevel}) indicates how important they are. More
 * important events may be logged to a database, while less important events
 * may just be logged to a local file. Event may not logged at all.</li>
 * <li>Their flow indicates to which category belongs the events. For example
 * some categories of events interest only developpers, while other categories
 * may interest system administrators, helpdesks, etc. See {@link LogFlowStd}
 * for the list of all currently existing flows.</li>
 * </ul>
 * For a {@link LogCenter} accepting an event two conditions have to be met:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The event <i>LogLevel</i> has to be superior or equal to the <i>LogLevel</i>
 * of the <i>LogCenter</i></li>
 * <li>The <i>LogCenter</i> flow has to accept the event flow. {@link #isAcceptable}
 * is the method checking this second condition.</i>
 * </ul>

 * @see LogFlowRegister
