 * 	<li>Any number of {@link EventReport} events, to log various informations the
 * 	developers found worthwhile to log.</i>
 * 	<li>During processing, regularly log {@link EventProgress} events, to inform about

 * 	<li>When finished processing, log a {@link EventReport} event, to summarize all

 * 	<li>One (and only one) {@link EventFinish} when the application finishes.</li>

 * This class allows to log a simple "Report".
